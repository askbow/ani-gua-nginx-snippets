# ani-gua-nginx-snippets
Animated-guacamole* nginx configurations snippets

# Why?
To keep useful configuration in one place, clean and neat.

# Is it good?
Probably. I've tested them with the latest nginx community release (at the time of commit) on a small site. There are no guaranties explicit or implied that it'll work with your setup. Test everything before going to production!
